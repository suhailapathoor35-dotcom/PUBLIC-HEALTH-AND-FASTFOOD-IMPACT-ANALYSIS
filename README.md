##  🥗 Public Health and Fast-Food Impact Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the relationship between fast-food consumption patterns and public health outcomes. By visualizing demographic data, dietary habits, and health metrics,
this dashboard identifies key risk factors and the physiological toll of high-frequency fast-food intake.
## 🎯 Key Objectives:
Identify Trends: Analyze which age groups and regions have the highest fast-food dependency.

Health Correlation: Visualize the direct link between consumption frequency and BMI/Chronic conditions.

Nutritional Impact: Contrast fast-food caloric density with daily recommended intake.

Actionable Insights: Provide a basis for public health awareness and dietary intervention.
 ## 📊 Dashboard Preview
The analysis is split into two primary focus areas:

Page 1: Demographic & Consumption Overview
Focuses on the "Who" and the "How Much."

Total Respondents: Global/Regional count of the surveyed population.

Consumption Frequency: Breakdown of daily vs. weekly vs. occasional consumers.

Preferred Food Types: Analysis of the most consumed fast-food categories.

## Page 2: Health Impact & Risk Assessment
Focuses on the physiological consequences.

BMI Distribution: Correlation between high intake and weight categories.

Disease Prevalence: Tracking Hypertension, Diabetes, and Digestive health.

Energy & Sleep: Impact of processed foods on daily vitality and rest quality.

## 🧬 Data Insights & MethodologyThe analysis utilizes a "Health Score" calculation to quantify the impact of diet:
$$Health\ Score = \frac{(Activity\ Level \times 0.4) + (Nutritional\ Balance \times 0.6)}{Fast\ Food\ Frequency}$$Key Findings:The 3x Rule: Individuals eating fast food more than 
3 times a week show a 25% higher risk of elevated blood pressure.Age Vulnerability: The 18–25 age demographic accounts for the highest caloric surplus.Sedentary Multiplier: Health scores 
drop significantly when high fast-food intake is combined with low physical activity.
